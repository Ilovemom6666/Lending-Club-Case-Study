## General Information

Problem Statement:

You work for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.  The data given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
The client is looking to deep dive into the data and get insights to help them reduce the overall default cases.

Objective :

The aim is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of the loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
